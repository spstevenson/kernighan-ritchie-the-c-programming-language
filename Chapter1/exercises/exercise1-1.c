#include <stdio.h>

main() {
	printf("hello, world\n");
}

/*
	Exercise 1-1 Run the "hello, world" program on your system. Experiment with
	leaving out parts of the program, to see what error messages you get.

	- Leaving out the printf line means no output is produced when the program is run.
	- Leaving out "main()" results in an "Expected identifier before "(" or "{" error message.
	- Leaving out "includes <stdio.h>" results in an incompatible implicit declaration of built
		in function message.
	- Leaving out the last "}" message results in expected declaration or statement at end of
	input message
